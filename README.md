# Line Follower
This was a project that has been done in the span of a day during a mini hackathon.\
### Technical Tasks
The main objectives of the mini hackathon were the following:
* to program a line follower with auto callibration for the sensors upon boot up;
* to implement and fine tune a PID controller which would enable the line follower to complete a test course as fast as possible.
### Components
1 x Arduino Uno, 1 x car chassis, 1 x ball bearing, 2 x DC motor, 2 x wheel, 1 x QTR-8A reflectance sensor array and wires (per logic).
