# Line Follower
This was a project that has been done in the span of a day during a mini hackathon.\
### Technical Tasks
The main objectives of the mini hackathon were the following:
* to program a line follower with auto callibration for the sensors upon boot up;
* to implement and fine tune a PID controller which would enable the line follower to complete a test course as fast as possible.
### Components
* 1 Arduino Uno;
* 1 car chassis; 
* 1 ball caster; 
* 2 DC motors; 
* L293D motor driver;
* 2 wheels; 
* 1 QTR-8A reflectance sensor array; 
* wires (per logic).
